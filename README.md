Better pivot-tables for Access with pivottable.js

## Why Better PivotTable for Access?

Microsoft Access has lost the ability to create pivot tables and pivot charts with version Access 2013. The official recommendation is to use Excel for this purpose. 

But why use Excel when we can have it in Access. There are many solutions for pivot tables based on Java Script available on the web. This project makes use of this.
We create pivot tables using the Pivottable.js library and display them in the web browser control. The whole logic is hidden in a class module.

Take a look at the demo and let yourself be inspired by the possibilities.
